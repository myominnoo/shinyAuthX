## Simplify User Authentication in Shiny Apps with `ShinyAuthX`

`ShinyAuthX` is a powerful R package specifically designed for user authentication within Shiny apps. It provides a comprehensive suite of authentication features including user sign-in, sign-up, sign-out, and password recovery, seamlessly integrating user-friendly UI and Server components. It empowers shiny app developers to create secure and user-friendly authentication systems.   

**Authentication Modules**: The sign-in module (`signinUI`, `signinServer`) enables users to authenticate themselves securely, while the sign-up feature (`signupUI`, `signupServer`) allows for hassle-free registration and account creation. With the sign-out module (`signoutUI`, `signoutServer`), users can conveniently sign out from your application, ensuring their privacy and security. In the event of a forgotten password, the password recovery module (`forgotpwUI`, `forgotpwServer`) facilitates a straightforward and efficient recovery process.


**Password Encryption**: Passwords are hashed using the `sodium` package, providing an additional layer of protection for user credentials. The source code of your main application is also protected until authentication is successful, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure.

**UI Integration**: `ShinyAuthX`'s modern UI designs are carefully crafted to provide a visually appealing and intuitive authentication experience for your users. The compatibility with Bootstrap themes ensures seamless integration with your existing Shiny app design, maintaining a consistent and professional look and feel throughout.

**Data integration**: Its flexibility in data storage options, both local and online database `MongoDB` using the `mongolite` package. This allows you to choose the database solution that best suits your application's needs and infrastructure.

**Verification Code via Email**: To further enhance the authentication experience, `shinyAuthX` leverages the `blastula` package to send custom emails, such as code verification during the sign-up process and password recovery emails. This ensures that users receive personalized and secure communications during critical steps of their authentication journey.

It's important to note that currently, `shinyAuthX` supports only `MongoDB` for database connection. The signup and password recovery features are optimized for `MongoDB` usage, providing the best experience and performance in this setup.

**Let's Get Started Today**: Experience the power and simplicity of `ShinyAuthX`, the ultimate suite of modules for user authentication in Shiny apps. Unlock the full potential of secure and user-friendly authentication and elevate your Shiny applications to new heights.

Please feel free to reach out to us with any questions or concerns. We're here to support you as you incorporate `shinyAuthX` into your Shiny apps.


## Demo Live!

[To add later]

### Installation

You can install the development version of shinyAuthX from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("myominnoo/shinyAuthX")
```


## Run example apps

Code for example apps in various contexts can be found in [inst/examples](inst/examples). You can launch these example apps with the `runExample` function. 

You can use the following `user`/`password` pairs: 
- `admin`/`admin`
- `user1`/`pass1`
- `user2`/`pass2`

See `?create_dummy_users` for dummy user credentials that are used in these examples.  

``` r
  runExample("basic-signin")
  runExample("basic-signin-mongodb")
  runExample("basic-signin-theme")
  runExample("basic-signup")
  runExample("signup-pw-reset")
  runExample("test-app")
```

## Usage

The package provides four module functions with corresponding UI and server elements:

- sign-in: `signinUI`, `signinServer`
- sign-out: `signoutUI`, `signoutServer`
- sign-up: `signupUI`, `signupServer`
- password recovery: `forgotpwUI`, `forgotpwServer`


Below is a minimal reproducible example of how to use the `sign-in` authentication modules in a shiny app. 


```

library(shiny)
library(shinyAuthX)

# dataframe that holds usernames, passwords and other user data
users_base <- create_dummy_users()

ui <- fluidPage(
	# add signout button UI
	div(class = "pull-right", signoutUI(id = "signout")),

  # add signin panel UI function without signup or password recovery panel
  signinUI(id = "signin", .add_forgotpw = FALSE, .add_btn_signup = FALSE),

  # setup output to show user info after signin
  verbatimTextOutput("user_data")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
	# Export reactive values for testing
	exportTestValues(
		auth_status = credentials()$user_auth,
		auth_info   = credentials()$info
	)

	# call the signout module with reactive trigger to hide/show
	signout_init <- signoutServer(
		id = "signout",
		active = reactive(credentials()$user_auth)
	)

  # call signin module supplying data frame,
  credentials <- signinServer(
    id = "signin",
    users_db = users_base,
    sodium_hashed = TRUE,
    reload_on_signout = FALSE,
    signout = reactive(signout_init())
  )

  output$user_data <- renderPrint({
    # use req to only render results when credentials()$user_auth is TRUE
    req(credentials()$user_auth)
    str(credentials())
  })
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```


## TODO:

1. add demo shiny apps hosted on shinyapps.io
2. add runExample(). 
3. add examples for each use case
	1. simple user signin 
	2. user signin with data.frame
	3. user signin with mongolite
	4. user signup with mongolite 
	5. user signup with mongolite plus email option [just codes; not run]


## Credits: 

We would like to extend our sincere gratitude and acknowledgments to the following individuals for their contributions to the development of `shinyAuthX`:

- Paul Campbell: The author of the `shinyauthr` package, from which we borrowed the `login` and `logout` module functions (`loginUI()`, `loginServer()`, `logoutUI()`, `logoutServer()`). Paul's work and dedication have significantly influenced the functionality and usability of `shinyAuthX`.

We would also like to specifically credit the following individuals for their contributions to the cookie-based authentication aspect of `shinyAuthX`:

- Michael Dewar: His expertise and contributions have played a crucial role in shaping the implementation of the cookie-based authentication mechanism in `shinyAuthX`. His insights have greatly enhanced the security and functionality of this feature.

- Calligross: Their valuable input and contributions have contributed to the development and improvement of the cookie-based authentication functionality in `shinyauthr`. 

For further information about their specific roles and contributions, we recommend visiting the [`shinyauthr`](https://github.com/PaulC91/shinyauthr) GitHub page, where you can find additional details about the original package and its contributors.

## Disclaimer: 

It is important to note that the security of any authentication system is a complex matter, and while we have taken great care in developing `shinyAuthX`, we cannot guarantee its foolproof security. The authentication process provided by `shinyAuthX` should be used with caution, and we strongly recommend implementing additional security measures based on your specific requirements. We endorse Paul Campbell's disclaimer statement regarding the security risks associated with the package. Please use `shinyAuthX` at your own risk.

We are grateful for the contributions and support from all the individuals mentioned above, as well as the wider community that has provided feedback and suggestions to help improve `shinyAuthX`. Thank you for your valuable contributions and continued support!
